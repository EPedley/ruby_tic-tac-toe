# ruby_tic-tac-toe

As part of my progress through The Odin Project I have created Tic Tac Toe with Ruby. I build this project using Replit.

The game:
- Uses a Class to initialise each instance of players
- Uses a Class to build the grid - this means it is customisable and could be a larger or smaller grid
- Asks the user where they would like to play
- Checks the validity of their input, i.e. are they trying to play off the board? Is there a token already there? If the input is not valid, the user is re-prompted
- Amends the grid instance
- Displays the new grid
- Calculates when there is a winner

Working through this project I have learnt how to do the following:
- Use Object Oriented programming to create more isolated, reusable code
- Use Classes
- Use instance methods and instance variables
- Use Self in Classes
- How to better understand scope
